Two-player tag game developed as the final project for the Nand2Tetris course.
---

Developed by **Romi Golan** and **Ruth Steinberg**.

## ðŸŽ® Game Overview

**Tofeset** (Hebrew for "Tag") is a nostalgic reinterpretation of the classic childhood game â€” but in digital form. Two players take turns chasing each other, and when a player is caught, a riddle must be solved together in order to proceed.

- `GameOn.jack` â€“ Handles gameplay: movement, collisions, and riddle logic.

## Technical Highlights

- Written in Jack language for the Hack platform
